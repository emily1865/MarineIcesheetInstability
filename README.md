This is for a class project for Earth and Climate Physics at the University of Copenhagen. There are three collaborators: Julia Gonzalez, Anna Weber, and Emily Wilbur. The project is overseen by Christine Hvidberg from the PICE group. The model and project are based on the paper "A minimal model of a tidewater glacier" by Oerlemans and Nick (2005).
